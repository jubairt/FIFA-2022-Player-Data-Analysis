The dataset underwent several key cleaning steps:  

1. **Dropped Irrelevant Columns**: Removed columns that were not necessary for the analysis.  
2. **Handled Missing Data**: Imputed or dropped missing values to maintain data integrity.  
3. **Standardized Column Names**: Renamed columns for better readability and consistency.  
4. **Outlier Detection**: Removed age outliers (players younger than 18 or older than 39).  
5. **Converted Data Types**: Converted market values and contract dates to appropriate data types for further analysis.
